## Approach Taken
- Designed a wireframe based off Netflix's web design.
- Created 4 separate controllers in order to better organize and control all the routes.
    -- User Controller - controls the sign in and register side of the application.
    -- Home Controller - controls the home page and reviews page which includes both movies and shows.
    -- Movies Contoller - controls the movies show page as well as the movie reviews edit page.
    -- Shows Controller - controls the shows show page as well as the movie reviews eidt page.
- Also created 3 separate models (User, Movies, and Shows).
- Created 5 separate views for the users, home, movies, shows, and partials to link my header and footer to all pages.  
- Focused on adding functionality to my pages while simultaneously adding CSS to them so I can have a better visual of my pages.

## Technologies Used
- Express
- Mongoose
- CRUD
- Node.js
- EJS

## Unsolved Problems
